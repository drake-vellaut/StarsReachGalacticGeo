<strong>Plans for the future if any of these interest you:<strong>
<ul>
<li>planning for the Grand Conservatory planet, this planet we want to be the place everyone in the galaxy comes to. Creating questlines and stories for players to come and enjoy themselves and feel ingrained in the universe. Creating open-zoos for public viewing for the safety of reachers and the animals. Museums, gardens, arts, education, and architecture to bring Reachers to the planet to enjoy. Events and Galas, where Reachers can participate and even host their own events in our large event spaces. Farms for locally sourced goods. Marketplace for small businesses and sustainably sourced goods at low prices. And so much more!</li>

<li>creating a seed/dna repository to help other guilds and planets that had their species go extinct and it caused a detrimental effect to their home planet</li>

<li>creating locally sourced restaurants spread across the galaxy (GUNCies is an example of this)</li>

<li>creating a decentralized network of merchants, artisans and refiners and keep track of those who offer sustainably sourced goods, consumer friendly business practices and small businesses to help others know where you can go knowing you will be getting products for proper prices and know where they came from</li>

<li>creating engineering and teamwork projects like Mycityum currently 52 homesteads</li>

<li>creating a planet to bring in tourism through crafted questlines and stories that make you feel like part of the lore. We want you to be able to earn reputation with GUNC by completing quests and attending events and buying from small businesses, etc</li>

<li>creating a galaxy wide logistics network for the transporting of goods from the furthest reaches of the galaxy back to our home planets and then out to all the planets we have a presence on so you can ensure we can help the widest range of people</li>

<li>we have 13 major “holiday/themed” events planned and we have already started planning for some of them. Just like our Hortus Renovare holiday, we plan on building lore and content for each of the events and holidays with every passing year to bring them truly to life</li>

<li>creating fun projects like the GUNC Archives, A History of Stars Reach Book (over 700 pages of photos and lore and content from devs), creating National Geographic Magazine but Stars Reach version, creating animal planet like documentaries in-game, an Aesop’s Fables like lore specifically for Stars Reach, and more as we figure out more ideas and players who want to help push them forward</li>

<li>working as teachers through the Stellar Wisdom Academy to help players understand the game at all levels</li>
